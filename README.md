# Finding the traction energy for an electric vehicle by Matlab Simulink simulation 

By integrating area under the curve for positive traction force we get the Traction Energy for acceleration to be 1299 Watt-Hour

By integrating area under the curve for negative traction force we get the Breaking Energy for decceleration to be 434.4 Watt-Hour

The total distance in the drive cycle is 10.93 hence average energy required for 1 km is 118.4 Watt-hour/km
